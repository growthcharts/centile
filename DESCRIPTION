Description: Defines a simple Reference Interchange Format (RIF) format for 
    growth references. Provides tools to import, validate, name and load 
    growth references as R objects. Converts measurements into Z-scores 
    or centile estimates, and vice versa. Supported distributions include the 
    normal, LMS, Box-Cox Green Cole (BCCG), Box-Cox Power Exponential (BCPE) 
    and Box-Cox t (BCT) distributions.
