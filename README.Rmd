The `centile` package

- Defines the reference interchange format (RIF), a simple text format for exchanging growth references;
- Provides tools for reading and validating RIF files;
- Names and loads references as `R` objects;
- Converts between measurements, Z-scores and centiles;
- Contains built-in WHO Multicentre Growth Standard for height, weight, head circumference and body mass index.

The currently supported distributions are normal (`NO`), Lambda-Mu-Sigma (`LMS`), 
Box-Cox Green Cole (`BCCG`), Box-Cox Power Exponential (`BCPE`) and Box-Cox t 
(`BCT`).
