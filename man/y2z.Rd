\title{Convert measurements into Z-scores}
\usage{
y2z(
  y,
  x,
  refcode,
  pkg = "centile",
  verbose = FALSE,
  dec = 3L,
  rule = 1L,
  tail_adjust = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numerical vector with measurements`.}

\item{x}{A vector containing \code{length(y)} values of the numerical covariate (typically
decimal age or height) at which conversion is desired. A scalar \code{x} will be
expanded to \code{length(y)}.}

\item{refcode}{A character vector with \code{length(y)} elements, each of which
points to a reference. Scalar \code{refcode} expands to \code{length(y)}.}

\item{pkg}{The package containing the references in the \code{R/sysdata.dta} object.
The package needs to be loaded. The default \code{pkg = "centile"} searches in
the \code{centile} package.}

\item{verbose}{Set to \code{TRUE} to turn on warnings}

\item{dec}{A scalar value indicating the number of decimals used to round the
value. The default is 3 decimals.}

\item{rule}{an integer (of length 1 or 2) describing how interpolation
    is to take place outside the interval [\code{min(x)}, \code{max(x)}].
    If \code{rule} is \code{1} then \code{NA}s are returned for such
    points and if it is \code{2}, the value at the closest data extreme
    is used.  Use, e.g., \code{rule = 2:1}, if the left and right side
    extrapolation should differ.}

\item{tail_adjust}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} the procedure applies the WHO
method for tail adjustment under the LMS distribution. We do not recommend
this. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{\dots}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A vector with \code{length(y)} elements containing the Z-scores.
}
\description{
Converts measurements into age- or hgt-conditional standard deviation scores
(SDS, Z-score) using one or more external reference distributions.
}
\note{
The type of reference distribution is defined by the \code{distribution} field
of the \code{study} attribute in the reference. The function executes
transformations specified by the \code{tx} and \code{ty} fields before calculating the
Z-score.

Functions \code{y2z()} and \code{z2y()} functions are the inverse of each other.

y <- c(50, 50, 60, 60, 4, 4, 4, 4)

             rep(c("who_2006_wgt_male_", "who_2006_wgt_female_"), 2))
